# Complete Fix Summary for Setlist Voting Web App

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Homepage Trending Data Not Updating
**Problem**: The homepage was trying to use `api.trending.getTrendingShows/Artists` which didn't exist.
**Solution**: 
- Created `convex/trending.ts` as an adapter to bridge PublicDashboard to the new `trending` system
- Updated `PublicDashboard.tsx` to use `api.trending` queries directly
- Modified the data transformation logic to handle the new data format with enriched artist/venue data
- Fixed artist click handlers to use actual artist IDs when available instead of always triggering import

### 2. ✅ Profile Page Authentication Issue
**Problem**: After signing in, clicking Profile would show the login form instead of the profile page.
**Solution**:
- Added `signInUrl="/signin"` to `RedirectToSignIn` component in `UserProfilePage.tsx`
- Added `signInUrl="/signin"` to `ClerkProvider` in `main.tsx` to ensure consistent routing

### 3. ✅ Artist Import Failures
**Problem**: Artists would sometimes fail to import when clicking on search results due to duplicate slugs.
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `createFromTicketmaster` in `convex/artists.ts` to handle duplicate slugs by appending numbers
- Added proper error handling with try-catch blocks in `triggerFullArtistSync`
- Added duplicate detection based on ticketmasterId to prevent re-creating existing artists

### 4. ✅ Spotify Integration Review
**Problem**: Need to ensure only studio songs are imported, not live recordings.
**Solution**:
- Confirmed `isStudioAlbum()` filters out live albums, compilations, and greatest hits
- Confirmed `isStudioSong()` filters out live tracks and bootlegs
- Integration correctly imports only studio recordings from albums

### 5. ✅ Cron Jobs and Sync System
**Problem**: Cron jobs weren't updating trending data properly.
**Solution**:
- The cron jobs in `convex/cron.ts` are correctly configured to run:
  - `update-trending`: Every 4 hours to update trending scores
  - `fix-missing-artist-data`: Every 6 hours to sync missing Spotify data
  - `check-completed-shows`: Every 6 hours to import setlists from completed shows
- Trending data is now stored directly in the `artists` and `shows` tables with `trendingRank` field
- Manual sync can be triggered with: `npx convex run maintenance:triggerTrendingSync`

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks and user-friendly error messages
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: Slug generation now handles duplicates gracefully
3. **Performance**: Trending data queries use indexed `by_trending_rank` for fast retrieval
4. **Data Integrity**: Artists are checked by ticketmasterId before creating duplicates
5. **User Experience**: Artists that already exist in DB navigate directly without re-import

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Homepage**: Verify trending artists/shows display correctly after running sync
2. **Search & Import**: Test searching for new artists and clicking to import
3. **Profile Access**: Sign in and verify Profile page shows correctly
4. **Cron Jobs**: Monitor logs to ensure cron jobs run successfully
5. **Manual Sync**: Run `npm run sync:trending` to manually update trending data

## Architecture Notes

- Trending scores are calculated based on:
  - Spotify popularity and followers
  - Number of upcoming shows
  - Recent sync activity
- Top 20 artists/shows get assigned `trendingRank` (1-20)
- The `trending` system is more efficient than the old separate trending tables
- All data flows through Convex actions/mutations for security and consistency
