The 2026 festival season is shaping up to be one of the most exciting years in live music history. After years of evolution in the festival landscape, major events have refined their experiences, expanded their lineups, and created unforgettable moments for millions of music fans. Whether you're a seasoned festival veteran or planning your first multi-day music adventure, this comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about the top US music festivals happening in 2026.

## Why 2026 Is Set to Be a Landmark Festival Year

The music festival industry has undergone a renaissance. Artists are prioritizing live performances more than ever, and festivals have responded with more immersive experiences, better amenities, and increasingly diverse lineups that span genres from indie rock to electronic dance music, hip-hop to country.

Major touring cycles from some of the world's biggest artists are converging in 2026, making this year particularly special for festival-goers. Additionally, several festivals are celebrating milestone anniversaries, promising special performances and reunions that won't be replicated.

## Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival

**Dates:** April 10-12 & April 17-19, 2026  
**Location:** Empire Polo Club, Indio, California  
**Expected Attendance:** 125,000+ per weekend

Coachella remains the crown jewel of American music festivals. Set against the stunning backdrop of the California desert, this two-weekend event consistently delivers the most talked-about performances of the year.

### What Makes Coachella Special

The festival's art installations have become legendary—massive sculptures, interactive experiences, and architectural marvels transform the polo grounds into an otherworldly landscape. The Sahara tent continues to host the biggest names in electronic music, while the main stage draws hundreds of thousands for headline performances.

### 2026 Lineup Predictions

Based on touring patterns and industry trends, expect headliners from the upper echelon of global music. Artists like **Beyoncé** (who delivered an iconic 2018 performance), **Kendrick Lamar**, and **Taylor Swift** are perennial rumors, though Coachella's booking team consistently surprises with unexpected choices.

The undercard typically features breakthrough artists who go on to headline within a few years. Keep an eye on rising stars in indie, electronic, and alternative genres who often use Coachella as a launchpad for their careers.

### Ticket Information

Coachella tickets typically go on sale in January and sell out within hours. General admission passes hover around $500, while VIP packages can exceed $1,000. The festival also offers camping options, shuttle passes, and various add-on experiences.

## Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival

**Dates:** June 11-14, 2026  
**Location:** Great Stage Park, Manchester, Tennessee  
**Expected Attendance:** 80,000+

Bonnaroo has cultivated a reputation as one of the most community-oriented festivals in America. The four-day camping festival creates a temporary city where music fans from across the country come together in the Tennessee heat.

### The Bonnaroo Experience

What sets Bonnaroo apart is its commitment to sustainability, community, and marathon sets. Artists often play extended performances, and the late-night programming continues until sunrise. The "Roo" culture emphasizes positivity—the festival's "Radiate Positivity" mantra has created one of the friendliest festival environments anywhere.

### Notable Artists to Watch

Bonnaroo has historically booked eclectic lineups that blend mainstream headliners with jam bands, electronic acts, and comedy performances. **Phish**, **Dead & Company**, and similar acts have found a spiritual home here, while hip-hop and pop headliners ensure broad appeal.

The festival's Which Stage and What Stage host the biggest acts, while The Other stage delivers cutting-edge electronic music through the night.

### Why Bonnaroo Stands Out for Setlist Enthusiasts

For fans who love tracking setlists, Bonnaroo is paradise. The extended set times mean artists often dig deep into their catalogs, playing rare tracks and extended jams that don't appear on typical tour stops. Many legendary performances—like Radiohead's 2012 set or Billy Joel's surprise 2015 appearance—have become the stuff of festival lore.

## Lollapalooza

**Dates:** July 30 - August 2, 2026  
**Location:** Grant Park, Chicago, Illinois  
**Expected Attendance:** 100,000+ daily

Perry Farrell's creation has evolved from a touring alternative rock festival into one of the world's premier music events. Set in downtown Chicago against the backdrop of the city skyline, Lollapalooza offers an urban festival experience unlike any other.

### The Urban Festival Experience

Unlike rural camping festivals, Lollapalooza's location means attendees have access to Chicago's world-class restaurants, hotels, and nightlife. The festival spans eight stages across Grant Park, with the main stages facing the iconic Chicago skyline.

### Genre Diversity

Lollapalooza has embraced the full spectrum of popular music. In recent years, lineups have featured everything from K-pop sensations like **BTS** to legacy rock acts like **Metallica**, hip-hop royalty like **J. Cole**, and pop superstars like **Dua Lipa**. This diversity makes Lollapalooza appealing to a broader audience than more genre-specific festivals.

### 2026 Expectations

The festival typically announces its lineup in March, with tickets going on sale shortly after. Four-day passes generally cost between $350-400, with single-day options available for those who can only attend part of the weekend.

## Austin City Limits Music Festival

**Dates:** October 2-4 & October 9-11, 2026  
**Location:** Zilker Park, Austin, Texas  
**Expected Attendance:** 75,000+ per weekend

ACL combines the legendary Austin music scene with a world-class festival experience. The two-weekend format, borrowed from Coachella, allows more fans to experience the festival while keeping daily attendance manageable.

### Austin's Musical Heritage

Austin's "Live Music Capital of the World" reputation isn't just marketing—the city's music scene genuinely influences ACL's booking. Texas artists often receive prominent billing, and the festival serves as a celebration of both global stars and local talent.

### What to Expect in 2026

ACL typically features a mix of rock, country, indie, and electronic artists that reflects Austin's diverse musical tastes. Recent headliners have included **Kendrick Lamar**, **Foo Fighters**, **Red Hot Chili Peppers**, and **P!nk**, suggesting the 2026 lineup will continue this trend of booking established superstars alongside breakthrough artists.

## Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) Las Vegas

**Dates:** May 15-17, 2026  
**Location:** Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Las Vegas, Nevada  
**Expected Attendance:** 150,000+ per night

For electronic music fans, EDC Las Vegas is the ultimate pilgrimage. The three-night festival transforms the Las Vegas Motor Speedway into a neon wonderland featuring the world's top DJs and producers.

### The EDC Experience

EDC is as much about the production as the music. Massive stage designs, carnival rides, art cars, and performers create an immersive experience that goes beyond typical concert settings. The festival runs from dusk until dawn, with the Nevada desert providing a dramatic backdrop.

### Top Electronic Artists

EDC consistently books the biggest names in electronic music across all subgenres. From main stage titans like **Tiësto**, **Martin Garrix**, and **Zedd** to underground house and techno acts, the festival covers the full electronic spectrum.

## Stagecoach Festival

**Dates:** April 24-26, 2026  
**Location:** Empire Polo Club, Indio, California  
**Expected Attendance:** 75,000+

Country music's answer to Coachella, Stagecoach has grown into the premier country and Americana festival in America. Held at the same venue one week after Coachella, Stagecoach offers a completely different vibe and audience.

### Country Music's Biggest Weekend

Stagecoach attracts country music's biggest stars alongside Americana, bluegrass, and roots rock artists. Past headliners have included **Luke Bryan**, **Thomas Rhett**, **Miranda Lambert**, and **Eric Church**. The festival also features line dancing, western-themed activities, and a distinctly country atmosphere.

### 2026 Lineup Possibilities

With country music experiencing a commercial renaissance, expect Stagecoach 2026 to feature both established stars and breakout artists. Names like **Morgan Wallen**, **Chris Stapleton**, **Lainey Wilson**, and **Zach Bryan** are likely candidates for headline slots.

## Ultra Music Festival

**Dates:** March 27-29, 2026  
**Location:** Bayfront Park, Miami, Florida  
**Expected Attendance:** 165,000+

Miami's Ultra Music Festival kicks off the American festival season each spring. The downtown Miami location, combined with the city's reputation as a global electronic music hub, makes Ultra a must-attend for EDM fans.

### Miami Music Week

Ultra serves as the centerpiece of Miami Music Week, when the city transforms into the global capital of electronic music. Hotel pools, nightclubs, and pop-up events feature artists from around the world, creating a week-long celebration that extends far beyond the festival grounds.

## Governor's Ball

**Dates:** June 5-7, 2026  
**Location:** Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Queens, New York  
**Expected Attendance:** 50,000+ daily

New York City's premier music festival, Governor's Ball brings world-class artists to Queens each June. The festival's New York location means access to the city's legendary nightlife, restaurants, and after-parties.

### NYC Festival Culture

Gov Ball has carved out a unique niche by booking lineups that reflect New York's diverse musical tastes. Hip-hop, indie rock, pop, and electronic acts share billing, creating an experience that feels distinctly New York.
