# Setlist Voting App - Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Artist Import and Search
- **Issue**: When searching for an artist and clicking on a Ticketmaster result, the app was trying to use the Ticketmaster ID as a Convex ID, causing navigation failures.
- **Fix**: Modified `SearchBar.tsx` to properly trigger artist sync and wait for the real artist ID before navigating.
- **Files Changed**: `src/components/SearchBar.tsx`

### 2. Artist Page Show Loading
- **Issue**: Shows weren't loading on artist detail pages.
- **Fix**: The `getByArtist` query was already correct, but the issue was related to the artist ID resolution. Fixed by ensuring proper artist creation and ID handling.
- **Files Changed**: Artist ID resolution logic in `SearchBar.tsx`

### 3. Trending Data Display
- **Issue**: Trending artists/shows weren't displaying properly on the homepage because the trendingArtists table only stored Ticketmaster IDs, not actual artist records.
- **Fix**: Modified `getTrendingArtists` query to enrich trending data with actual artist records by looking up artists by their Ticketmaster ID.
- **Files Changed**: `convex/trending.ts`

### 4. Spotify Catalog Import
- **Issue**: Studio songs filter was too restrictive, potentially missing valid studio albums.
- **Fix**: Enhanced the `isStudioAlbum` function to better detect live albums and compilations, ensuring only studio recordings are imported.
- **Files Changed**: `convex/spotify.ts`

### 5. Deployment Trending Sync
- **Issue**: Trending data wasn't being populated on deployment.
- **Fix**: 
  - Created `convex/deployment.ts` with an `onDeploy` function
  - Added post-deployment scripts
  - Added npm scripts for manual trending sync
- **Files Changed**: `convex/deployment.ts`, `scripts/post-deploy.sh`, `package.json`

## Cron Jobs Review

The app has 4 cron jobs running:
1. **fix-missing-artist-data** (every 6 hours) - Fixes artists with missing Spotify data
2. **sync-trending-data** (every 12 hours) - Syncs trending artists/shows from APIs
3. **data-cleanup** (every 24 hours) - Cleans up orphaned records
4. **check-completed-shows** (every 6 hours) - Imports setlists from setlist.fm

## Manual Actions Required

1. **Initial Trending Sync**: Run `npm run sync:trending` after deployment
2. **Post-Deployment**: Run `npm run post-deploy` after each deployment
3. **Admin Dashboard**: Use the admin dashboard to manually trigger trending sync if needed

## Data Flow Summary

1. **Artist Search**: User searches → Ticketmaster API → Create artist record → Sync shows & catalog
2. **Show Import**: Artist created → Ticketmaster API for shows → Create venue & show records
3. **Song Catalog**: Artist created → Spotify API → Import studio albums/songs only
4. **Trending Data**: Cron job → Ticketmaster API → Store in trendingArtists/trendingShows tables → Enrich with actual records on query

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test artist search and import flow
2. Verify shows load on artist pages
3. Check trending data displays on homepage
4. Confirm studio songs are imported correctly
5. Test post-deployment trending sync
