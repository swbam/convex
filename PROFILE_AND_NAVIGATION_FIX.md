### 3. **Navigation Updates**

#### Desktop Dropdown Menu:
- "Profile" → "Settings" (with Settings icon)
- "My Library" → "My Activity" (with Activity icon)

#### Mobile Bottom Navigation:
- Removed Profile as a main tab
- Only shows: Home, Artists, Shows, Trending
- Added 5th "Menu" button that:
  - Shows "Sign In" when logged out → goes to signin
  - Shows "Menu" when logged in → opens mobile sidebar

### 4. **Activity Page**
- Route: `/activity`
- Uses UserDashboard component (shows user's predictions/votes)
- Accessible via dropdown menu and profile page

## 🔒 Privacy & Access

- Profile/Settings is NOT publicly accessible
- Only authenticated users can access `/profile`
- No public-facing user profiles
- Settings focused on:
  - Account preferences
  - Notification settings
  - Security settings
  - Activity history (votes/setlists)

## 📱 Mobile UX

- Profile/Settings accessible via Menu button → opens sidebar
- Clean 4-tab bottom navigation for main content
- User menu consolidated into sidebar for mobile

The app now properly separates public content (artists, shows, trending) from private user settings, with profile functionality focused solely on account management and activity tracking.
