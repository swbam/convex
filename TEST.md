This app is not 100% complete!!! stop telling me that!!! ULTRATHINK 3x then review the codebase again. then test the app yourself using the playwright mcp. use safari browser to test as a user. start by running the app then in safari once the app loads search for "treaty oak revival". then make sure all shows import, the artist is created in my db, venues created, and entire studio song catalog (from spotify api) is fully imported to my db. And make sure on their artist page all shows load, then click a show page, on the show page make sure the initial 5 random songs from the song catalog show on the setlist, make sure the dropdown shows were their entire song catalog from the db so i can add a new song to the setlist, then add a song to the setlist, and vote on a song and make sure the votes are then showing in the db and the song was added to the setlist in the db. ultrathink 3x!!!
