## üéØ **SPOTIFY-ONLY FOLLOWING SYSTEM**

- **`requireSpotifyUser()`**: Helper function that validates user has `spotifyId`
- **`isSpotifyUser()`**: Query to check if current user is Spotify-authenticated
- **Proper Error Messages**: Clear feedback when non-Spotify users try to follow

#### üéµ **Follow Functions (Spotify Users Only)**
- **`toggleArtistFollow()`**: Follow/unfollow with Spotify validation
- **`getFollowedArtists()`**: Get user's followed artists with show counts
- **`getFollowStatus()`**: Bulk follow status checking for UI
- **`getArtistFollowers()`**: Public follower counts and recent followers
- **`getUserSpotifyArtistsWithShows()`**: Spotify artists with upcoming concerts

### ‚úÖ **Frontend Components**

#### üéõÔ∏è **SpotifyFollowButton** (`SpotifyFollowButton.tsx`)
- **Spotify-Only Logic**: Only shows for Spotify users
- **Smart Error Handling**: Clear messaging for non-Spotify users
- **Multiple Variants**: Full button and compact heart button
- **`SpotifyRequiredButton`**: Shows for non-Spotify users with educational message

#### üì± **Enhanced Profile Page** (`EnhancedProfilePage.tsx`)
**Conditional Tabs**:
- **2 Tabs** for regular users: Overview + Activity
- **3 Tabs** for Spotify users: Overview + Activity + **My Artists**

**Spotify Artists Tab Features**:
- **Followed Artists**: Artists the user follows with show counts
- **Your Spotify Artists**: Artists from user's Spotify with upcoming shows
- **Top Artist Rankings**: Shows user's top Spotify artists with badges
- **New Show Notifications**: Alerts when followed artists have new shows

## üé® **USER EXPERIENCE**

- **Spotify Integration**: Sync with user's actual Spotify data

## üîÑ **ACTIVITY SYSTEM INTEGRATION**

### ‚úÖ **Activity Tracking**

- **Activity Feed**: Shows follow activities with artist details
- **Statistics**: Follow counts in user stats (Spotify users only)
- **Global Feed**: Public follow activities (anonymized)

### ‚úÖ **Conditional Display**
- **Stats Cards**: Shows "Artists Followed" for Spotify users, "Community Rank" for others
- **Activity Icons**: Heart icons for follow activities
- **Tab Visibility**: "My Artists" tab only visible to Spotify users

## üéØ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### ‚úÖ **Spotify User Detection**
```typescript
// Backend validation
const { userId, user } = await requireSpotifyUser(ctx);
// Throws error if user.spotifyId is not set

// Frontend detection  
const isSpotifyUser = useQuery(api.spotifyFollowing.isSpotifyUser);
// Returns true only if user has spotifyId
```

### ‚úÖ **Security & Validation**
- **Backend Protection**: All follow functions validate Spotify authentication
- **Frontend Guards**: UI elements conditionally render based on Spotify status

- **Data Integrity**: Only Spotify users can create follow relationships

### ‚úÖ **Integration with Existing Systems**
- **User Schema**: Uses existing `spotifyId` field in users table

- **Artist Cards**: Smart follow buttons that adapt to user type
