# Concert Setlist App - Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Convex URL Mismatch
- **Problem**: The app was using an old Convex URL (`necessary-mosquito-453`) instead of the current deployment (`exuberant-weasel-22`)
- **Fix**: Updated `.env.local` and verified the correct URL through `npx convex deploy`

### 2. ✅ Clerk Authentication Configuration
- **Problem**: The auth config was using an environment variable that might not be set
- **Fix**: Hardcoded the Clerk issuer domain in `convex/auth.config.ts`

### 3. ✅ Local Build and Testing
- **Problem**: Needed to ensure the app builds correctly
- **Fix**: Successfully built the app locally with no errors

### 4. ❌ Vercel Environment Variables (ROOT CAUSE)
- **Problem**: The deployed app shows "Something went wrong" because environment variables are not set on Vercel
- **Fix Required**: Add these environment variables in Vercel Dashboard:
  ```
  VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://exuberant-weasel-22.convex.cloud
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_cXVpZXQtcG9zc3VtLTcxLmNsZXJrLmFjY291bnRzLmRldiQ
  ```

## Action Required

The app is successfully deployed but showing an error because **environment variables are missing on Vercel**. 

To fix this:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**: convex-sable
3. **Navigate to**: Settings → Environment Variables
4. **Add the following variables**:
   - `VITE_CONVEX_URL` = `https://exuberant-weasel-22.convex.cloud`
   - `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` = `pk_test_cXVpZXQtcG9zc3VtLTcxLmNsZXJrLmFjY291bnRzLmRldiQ`
5. **Redeploy**: Either push a commit or manually redeploy from Vercel dashboard

## Additional Improvements Made

1. **Enhanced Diagnostic Page**: Updated `DiagnosticApp.tsx` to show clear instructions when environment variables are missing
2. **Fixed Convex Auth Config**: Removed dependency on potentially missing environment variable
3. **Updated Documentation**: Created clear setup guides

## Testing

- ✅ Local build successful
- ✅ Local preview working correctly
- ✅ Convex backend accessible
- ✅ Authentication configuration updated
- ⏳ Waiting for Vercel environment variables to be set

Once you add the environment variables to Vercel and redeploy, the app should work correctly!
