      review the codebase for my concert setlist voting web app. then start it
      and search for the artist "ariana grande", view the artist page, click a
      show, then on the show page vote on one song and then seleect a song from
      the dropdown so it adds to the setlist. Then use the convex mcp thats
      running to see if the artist was created in the artists table, along with
      all of their shows in the shows table, venues all created in the venues
      table, and their entire spotify song catalog imported to the songs table.
      and make sure the votes and setlist songs tables had those actions added
      to their tables.
