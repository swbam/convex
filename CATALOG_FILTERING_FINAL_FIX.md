# 🎯 Catalog Filtering - FINAL CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION

## ✅ **THE RIGHT APPROACH**

### **Strategy**:
1. ✅ **Strict album filtering** - Only ORIGINAL studio albums
2. ✅ **Strict song filtering** - Check BOTH song title AND album name
3. ✅ **Smart deduplication** - Keep only ONE version of each song
4. ✅ **NO live, remix, remaster, deluxe, bonus**

## 🔧 **What Was Wrong Before**

### **Mistake 1**: Including Deluxe/Remastered Albums
```
❌ Kept: "Hotel California (Remastered)"
❌ Kept: "Hotel California (Deluxe Edition)"
Result: DUPLICATES of same songs!
```

### **Mistake 2**: Not Checking Album Name in Song Filter
```
❌ Album: "Eagles Live"
❌ Song: "Hotel California" (from live album!)
❌ Filter only checked song title, not album
Result: LIVE SONGS imported!
```

---

## ✅ **The Correct Implementation**

### **Album Filter** (Strict):
```typescript
Exclude if album name contains:
❌ 'live', 'concert', 'unplugged'
❌ 'greatest hits', 'best of', 'collection'
❌ 'deluxe', 'remaster', 'expanded', 'anniversary'
❌ 'bonus', 'extended', 'special edition'
❌ 'soundtrack', 'ost'

Only keep:
✅ album_type === 'album' (not singles)
✅ total_tracks >= 8 (full albums only)
✅ Clean album name (no keywords above)
```

### **Song Filter** (Ultra Strict):
```typescript
Check BOTH song title AND album name:

Exclude if EITHER contains:
❌ 'live', 'remix', 'remaster', 'demo'
❌ 'instrumental', 'karaoke', 'acoustic'
❌ 'version', 'edit', 'alternate'
❌ 'feat.', 'featuring', 'ft.' (often duplicates)
❌ 'bonus', 'reprise'

Also exclude:
❌ intro, outro, interlude, skit (exact match)
```

### **Deduplication** (Smart):
```typescript
If "Hotel California" appears multiple times:
1. Group by normalized title
2. Keep version from EARLIEST album
3. Prefer higher popularity
4. Result: ONE "Hotel California" ✅
```

✅ No live songs
✅ No remixes
✅ No duplicates
