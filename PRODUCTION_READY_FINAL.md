## 🚨 **CRITICAL: Vercel Environment Variable**

**YOU MUST UPDATE THIS MANUALLY IN VERCEL DASHBOARD:**

```
Variable: VITE_CONVEX_URL
Value:    https://exuberant-weasel-22.convex.cloud
Env:      Production ✅

Steps:
1. https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
3. Update VITE_CONVEX_URL
4. Check "Production"
5. Save
6. Redeploy
```

**Without this, setlists.live will still use dev database!**

---

## 📊 **Production Database Status**

```
Artists:  4 (Taylor Swift, Zach Bryan, Billy Joel, Eagles)
Shows:    69+ (Eagles: 20, Billy Joel: 5, etc.)
Venues:   10+
Songs:    250+ (importing)
Users:    0 (needs Spotify OAuth sign-in)
```
