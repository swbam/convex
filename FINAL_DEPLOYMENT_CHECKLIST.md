# ✅ Final Deployment Checklist - Complete System Fix

## 🎯 **Systematic Fix Plan - EXECUTING NOW**

---

## ✅ **Phase 1: Fix Build Errors** - COMPLETE

```
❌ Before: JSX tag mismatches preventing build
✅ After: Build successful in 1.60s

Files Fixed:
- src/components/ShowDetail.tsx (removed FadeIn wrappers)
- Build output: 455KB (119KB gzipped)
```

---

## 🔄 **Phase 2: Import Eagles to Production** - IN PROGRESS

```bash
✅ Step 1: Search for Eagles
   Result: ticketmasterId: K8vZ9171ob7, 20 upcoming events

✅ Step 2: Import on production
   Command: npx convex run ticketmaster:triggerFullArtistSync --prod
   
⏳ Step 3: Verify import
   - Check shows created
   - Check songs imported
   - Verify all fields populated
```

---

## ⚠️ **Phase 3: Fix Vercel Environment** - PENDING

**CRITICAL: You must update this in Vercel Dashboard!**

```
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select: Your project
3. Settings → Environment Variables
4. Update: VITE_CONVEX_URL = https://exuberant-weasel-22.convex.cloud
5. Environment: Production ✅
6. Save
7. Redeploy
```

**This makes setlists.live use PRODUCTION database!**

---

## 🔍 **Phase 4: Debug Catalog Import** - IN PROGRESS

**Issue**: Only 2 albums importing for Eagles (should be 10+)

**Investigation**:
```
Total albums from Spotify: 20
Filtered to studio albums: 2  ← TOO AGGRESSIVE!
Songs imported: 19
```

**Eagles Studio Albums** (Should Import):
1. Eagles (1972) ✅
2. Desperado (1973) ✅
3. On the Border (1974) ?
4. One of These Nights (1975) ?
5. Hotel California (1976) ?
6. The Long Run (1979) ?
7. Long Road Out of Eden (2007) ?

**Next**: Add debug logging to see WHY albums are filtered out

---

## 🚀 **Remaining Steps**

### **Step 1: Verify Production Import**
```bash
# Check if Eagles shows created on prod
npx convex data shows --prod | grep -i eagle

# Check if songs imported
npx convex data songs --prod | grep -i "hotel california\|take it easy"
```

### **Step 2: Fix Catalog Filtering**
```bash
# Add debug logging to see which albums are filtered
# Re-deploy with improved logic
# Re-import Eagles
# Verify 100+ songs
```

### **Step 3: Update Vercel** (MANUAL)
```
⚠️ YOU MUST DO THIS IN VERCEL DASHBOARD!
Cannot be done via CLI - must use web interface
```

### **Step 4: Final Testing**
```bash
# After Vercel update and redeploy:
1. Visit: https://setlists.live
2. Search: Eagles
3. Click result
4. Verify: 20 shows visible
5. Verify: 100+ songs in catalog
6. Test: Vote on setlist
7. Test: Get Tickets button → Affiliate URL
```
