# 🚨 CRITICAL: 404 Error on Direct URL - COMPREHENSIVE FIX

## ❌ **The Problem**

**Issue**: `https://www.setlists.live/artists/eagles` returns 404

**Symptoms**:
- ✅ Clicking artist card works
- ❌ Pasting URL in new tab = 404
- ❌ Sharing links = 404
- ❌ Bookmarks = 404

**This is a CRITICAL production bug!**

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

This is a **Single Page Application (SPA) routing issue**:

```
When you click in the app:
  React Router changes URL → No server request → Works ✅

When you paste URL directly:
  Browser requests /artists/eagles from server
  Server looks for /artists/eagles file
  File doesn't exist
  Server returns 404 ❌
```

**The server must serve `index.html` for ALL routes!**

---

## ✅ **The Complete Fix (4-Layer Approach)**

### **1. Simplified vercel.json** (Root):
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why simplified?**
- Removed conflicting `routes` section
- Removed complex redirect (handle at Vercel dashboard)
- Just the essential: serve index.html for everything

### **2. Public _redirects File**:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

### **3. Public vercel.json** (Backup):
```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

### **4. Vite Config**:
```typescript
server: {
  historyApiFallback: true,  // For local dev
}
```

---

## 🎯 **What Each Fix Does**

### **Root vercel.json**:
- Used by Vercel during deployment
- Tells Vercel: "serve index.html for all non-asset requests"
- Simple = less chance of errors

### **public/_redirects**:
- Copied to dist/ during build
- Fallback for Netlify/Cloudflare/generic hosts
- Universal SPA pattern

### **public/vercel.json**:
- Copied to dist/ during build
- Extra insurance for Vercel
- Overrides root config if needed

### **vite.config.ts**:
- For local development only
- Makes `npm run dev` work with direct URLs

---

## 🧪 **Testing Guide**

### **Test Locally First**:
```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Navigate to artist
Click on artist → URL: http://localhost:5173/artists/eagles

# 3. Copy URL

# 4. Open NEW TAB and paste
Result: ✅ Should work (historyApiFallback)
```

### **Test Production After Deploy**:
```bash
# 1. Deploy
npm run all

# 2. Test these URLs directly (paste in browser):
https://setlists.live/artists/eagles
https://setlists.live/shows/some-show
https://setlists.live/trending
https://setlists.live/activity

Result: ✅ All should work (no 404)
```

## 🌐 **WWW Redirect** (Separate Issue)

**Note**: `https://www.setlists.live` → `https://setlists.live` redirect is NOT handled in vercel.json!

**Configure in Vercel Dashboard**:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Settings → Domains
4. Add both domains:
   - `setlists.live` (primary)
   - `www.setlists.live` (redirect to primary)
5. Vercel automatically sets up 301 redirect

**Don't configure domain redirects in vercel.json** - they belong in the dashboard!

## 📁 **File Structure After Build**

```
dist/
├── index.html          ← Main entry point
├── _redirects          ← SPA fallback (universal)
├── vercel.json         ← SPA fallback (Vercel-specific)
└── assets/
    ├── main-*.css
    └── main-*.js
```

---

## 🔧 **How It Works Now**

```
User visits: https://setlists.live/artists/eagles
  ↓
1. Vercel receives HTTP request
  ↓
2. Checks vercel.json rewrites:
   source: "/(.*)" matches "/artists/eagles"
   destination: "/index.html"
  ↓
3. Vercel serves: index.html
  ↓
4. Browser loads React app
  ↓
5. React Router reads URL: /artists/eagles
  ↓
6. Router matches route: /artists/:artistSlug
  ↓
7. Renders <App /> component
  ↓
8. App queries: api.artists.getBySlugOrId({ key: "eagles" })
  ↓
9. Convex returns artist data
  ↓
10. Renders ArtistDetail component
  ↓
✅ ARTIST PAGE DISPLAYED!
```

## 🚀 **Deploy Steps**

```bash
# 1. Build is already done (1.63s)
✅ npm run build

# 2. Deploy to Vercel
npm run deploy:frontend

# Or deploy everything:
npm run all
```

## 🎯 **Post-Deployment Verification**

After deploying, test these URLs by **pasting them directly**:

```
✅ https://setlists.live/
✅ https://setlists.live/artists/eagles

✅ https://setlists.live/shows/some-show-slug
✅ https://setlists.live/trending
✅ https://setlists.live/activity
✅ https://setlists.live/profile
```

**All should load without 404!**
